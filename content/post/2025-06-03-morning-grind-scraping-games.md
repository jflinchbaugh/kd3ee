[Morning Grind](https://www.k3ir.org/the-morning-grind-net)
uses NetLogger to log,
and it has an API I can use to scrape check-ins:
- https://www.netlogger.org/api/The%20NetLogger%20XML%20Data%20Service%20Interface%20Specification.pdf
- https://www.netlogger.org/api/GetActiveNets.php
- https://www.netlogger.org/api/GetCheckins.php?ServerName=NETLOGGER&NetName=The%20Morning%20Grind
- https://www.netlogger.org/api/GetPastNets.php
- https://www.netlogger.org/api/GetPastNetCheckins.php?ServerName=NETLOGGER&NetName=The%20Morning%20Grind&NetID=361909

The question of the day was: What games do you play?
Lots of good discussion ensued.
I offered [Morsle](https://morsle.fun/),
and W3EO offered [free42, hp42 emulator](https://thomasokken.com/free42/).
