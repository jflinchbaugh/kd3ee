## Changes

R1CBU 0.30.0 brings several notable changes:

* The ATT/PRE indicator has been split again,
  allowing them to operate independently.
* A fix for storing/loading
  of the ATU network has been implemented.
  This is a different implementation from the PR I submitted.
* Controls for an alternate patched baseband have been added,
  though I haven't tried the new baseband yet.

## Testing

The software continues to reload preferences
from the previous version,
which is good.
The UI changes look promising.
However,
the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF)
has been low for the past couple of weeks,
making 20M barely usable today.
Despite that challenge,
I can still see my reports
on PSKReporter on 20M.
I've been keeping my power
at around 2W for the past couple of months.
My first contact with this new firmware
was hunting a park near Memphis, TN, on FT8, using 2W.
