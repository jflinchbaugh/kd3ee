Rain was predicted later in the weekend,
so I headed out
to Marietta Riverfront Park
([US-4567](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4567))
for a quick activation to beat the rain.
My initial plan was to rebuild my EFHW antenna,
but I cut the new wire six inches too short,
and I didn't have enough wire on the spool to start again.

I opted for my 12.5m EFRW instead.
It was 7 PM, so I focused my efforts on the 40m.
I successfully got about 18 contacts before I packed up for the evening.
