### Portable Doublet
I built a doublet experiment at a park today.
- split 6.25M of speaker wire
  to be a 12.5M-long, center-fed, non-resonant dipole,
  like my portable EFRW I usually carry.
- the rest is balanced feed line
- right to the radio
- tuned 20M and barely tuned 40M on my X6100
- 2W FT8 heard in africa and europe
- next try it with a 4:1 or 9:1 balun to match better

### My Weeks in Radio
- feel lucky to be in this area with lots of repeaters and traffic
- flagpole with YAGI snapped in the wind a week or 2 ago.
- strung the slim jim in the tree a little higher
- playing with nicsure firmware on the RadTel RT-880G.
- saw a great youtube video on APRS bots:
  - MPAD being very versatile for:
    weather, callsign lookup, location report to email
  - ISS bot that tells you the next pass
- listened to a couple sweepstakes contacts:
  to lazy to try to communicate that much exchange QRP SSB
