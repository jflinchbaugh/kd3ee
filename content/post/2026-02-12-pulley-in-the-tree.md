I brought down the Slim Jim
with its existing halyard
that's slung over a branch in the front tree.
I used the that halyard
to pull a throw weight and pulley
on a new line into the same spot.
I dropped the pulley straight down from high spot in the tree,
and pulled the halyard out completely.
I ran halyard line
through the new pulley
and hoisted it back up into the tree.
Now the Slim Jim hangs free
instead of tangled up through the tree.
