While waiting for the train in Exton, PA,
I looked up Amtrak frequencies
for the Keystone corridor
and found they're mostly all 160MHz-161MHz,
so I scanned there.
I didn't hear train traffic
in the time,
but I heard Chester County emergency dispatch
on 160.185MHz.
I can also hear it at home
with an outside antenna.
