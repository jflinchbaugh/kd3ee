I saw an opening on 6M just now.
I was getting contacts an my 71-foot random wire at home
about 1000 miles away:
Florida and the midwest.
10M is looking similar,
even though the MUF map says only up to 21MHz should work.
15M is getting to Southwest,
but it's mostly like 10M.
Later in the day, around 2pm local,
6M is open to Wisconsin more than Florida.
