While on a trip to New York with the kids,
I activated a couple parks.

### Bashakill Wildlife Management

At [US-9136](https://pota.app/#/park/US-9136),
I parked in the middle,
and threw the 40m EFHW into a tree
to operate 20M and some 40M,
FT4 & FT8
I made 13 contacts in the US, Sweden, Germany, and Spain.
I got sweat on (in?) the touchpad
of the laptop,
so the pointer was being very jumpy
and hard to control.

### Highland Lakes State Park

On the edge of [US-2074](https://pota.app/#/park/US-9136),
I barely got my 10 contacts in time.
I used the magnetic loop,
and aligned it to go up and down the coast on 40M.
