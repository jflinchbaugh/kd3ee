Ben and I grabbed dinner
and headed to the Columbia Riverfront Park
to activate
{{<pota US-4567>}}, Capt John Smith Trail].

Since there were more people around,
I setup the simple GRA-1900T
next to our picnic table
instead of throwing wires.
20m was very busy,
so I was getting a bit lost
in all the traffic.
I moved to 40m
and re-tuned
to rack up my more local contacts.
As the sun set,
our reach got better on 40m.
Of course,
I accidentally crossed 0000UTC again into the next day,
so it was 2 activations: one (incomplete) with 5 QSOs,
and the other with 14 QSOs.
I operated all digital,
since it got dark,
and we were looking to pack up soon.
