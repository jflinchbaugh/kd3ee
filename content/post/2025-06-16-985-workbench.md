### My Week in Radio
- 80M EFHW out in the elements
  - needed cleaning/repair for corrosion and high SWR
  - interesting to reintroduce pieces to see their effect:
    - counterpoise
    - capacitor
- checked into the APRSThursday net right away in the morning
  - automatically stayed subscribed for 12 hours
  - received 174 messages over 12 hours
  - across the US and rest of the world
- headed to Los Angeles for 12 days
  - find some parks
  - get back for 1 day of field day
### Others
- W3CRW, CR:
  - Chuck's presentation on connectors
- W1RC, Mike:
  - fiddling with allstar
- N3RBN, Paul:
  - back on the air with pass-through panel in the window
- NA3CW, Chuck:
  - busy with coax
  - inherited lots of coax from a SK in West Chester
    - we don't want the RG-11 (75ohm)G
    - tangle
  - used it to demo the new and old connectors and repairs
  - more cable and connectors after breakfast
- KB3ILS, Keith:
  - drawn back to the radio for field day
  - bands rough for low power work
  - learning about bandpass filters, and their design
    - induction and capacitances
    - measuring with nanovna and oscilloscope
- KC3YSM, Steve:
  - learned about the coax connectors
- WA3KFT, John:
  - finishing touches on shack
    - shortening cables, etc
  - has a set of tools that makes it really easy to terminate PL-259
- KC3OOK, Bill:
  - attended the connector course
  - learned to analyze coax
  - Saw Ron's article about ARRL Chester County Field Day on MSN news:
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/arrl-amateur-radio-field-day/ar-AA1GIEyc
- KC3SQI, Wayne:
  - base for tilt-over mast is in concrete
  - tilt conduit mounted
  - figuring out locks
- WA3VEE, Ron:
  - helped restring a 40M dipole at field day site
    - resonant right at 7MHz
    - took 6-inches off each end to get to 7.150MHz
  - everyone encouraged to visit field day
- K3FHA, John:
  - working on some test equipment
- KC3RFG, Jim:
  - repairing a mobile antenna
  - getting some good distance on 6M for the first time
- W3KZG, Scott:
  - building camper/comms trailer
    - will bring it for field day
### Questions
- N3RBN, Paul:
  - RJ-something microphone connectors and cables,
    is there a way to straighten the coiled part
    to attach a new connector?
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - don't know about straightening,
      but has wired a new cord to the mic.
    - could buy a cheap mic and steal the cable
  - W3KZG, Scott:
    - seconds buying a cheap/clone mic for the cable
- KC3SQI, Wayne:
  - What's the connector number for PL-259s Chuck used?
    - Chuck will email links.
  - Going to a mast that can support more than one antenna.
    should he pull a whole run for the 2M antenna,
    or try to route it through the remote switcher that's good to 6M?
    - WA3VEE, Ron:
      - try to go with as few connectors as possible,
        especially on VHF/UHF
      - also, respect that 6M limitation on the switcher
    - KC3RFG, Jim:
      - home run is always better
      - the switcher may bleed signal to other lines
    - WA3VEE, Ron:
      - try to operate to the middle of the specs of gear
    - WA3KFT, John:
      - 14 coax runs into the shack
      - 14 switches for choosing radios
      - favorite switch is from Waters.
