I activated the Conoy Wetland along
[US-4567](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4567).
I used the 40M EFHW running to the South East.
I stayed on 40m, using FT8 and 4W.
I got my 30+ contacts calling CQ POTA,
and didn't chase anyone.

I experimented with the counterpoise:
- I saw 1.5:1 SWR with the counterpoise coiled up.
- I saw a lower SWR with the counterpoise unwound.
