While driving to winter field day,
I heard lots of fldigi/flmsg messages
sent and received during a drill
on the W3EOC repeater system.
They assigned municipalities
to each operator
to call them
for reports.

I found the
[old AndFlmsg from sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/files/AndFlmsg/)
wouldn't install on modern Android,
so I couldn't immediately decode messages.

I found and installed a
[new version of AndFlMsg](https://github.com/VK2ETA/AndFlmsg),
from a new provider.
I'll be ready to follow along the next time.
