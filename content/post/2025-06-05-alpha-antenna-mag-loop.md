I purchased the
Alpha Antenna Alpha Loop Jr+ Mag Loop
from Tom, KA3TKW.
It's built of a tuner box,
loops of LMR400,
and a tripod,
and tunes 40m-10m.

Tuning is pretty cool with the geared box,
but still pretty touchy.
Tuning is _very_ necessary:
a band will be completely quiet until tuned,
and then noise and signal really increases.
I tried it inside,
and it didn't work so well:
lots of inside RFI.

Outside, it worked much better,
but the 80M EFHW is still better:
higher, and broader bandwidth.

The directionality and tuning is neat
I can wiggle the spacing of the inner loop
to the outer loop to "adjust" induction / SWR.
The high Q means efficiency,
but I need to re-tune the capacitor
any time I move around the band.
