I activated {{<pota US-8878>}}, State Game Land 181.
It's my 39th unique park activated on my way to the next award at 40.
I made 11 FT8 contacts at 2-4W
with my speaker-wire doublet pulled up into a tree.
I had extended the length to 44ft length
per some online recommendations.

The battery was low on my little Evolve 3 laptop,
and I wanted to charge it from LiFePO,
but it wouldn't charge.
It turns out
that I had inserted the barrel adapter into the headphone jack
instead of the tiny power port.
The laptop had died at 9 contacts with 3 people calling me,
so I switched to my other laptop to finish up.

10M tuned OK, 40M tuned OK,
and 20M tuned easily, _but_ with both laptops,
the radio would drop the USB connection immediately 
upon transmitting.
I may need to add a current balun
between the radio and matching transformer.
