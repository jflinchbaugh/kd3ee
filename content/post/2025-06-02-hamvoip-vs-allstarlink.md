I was curious about the different implementations
for building an AllStar node.

[HamVOIP](https://hamvoip.org/)
is closed source,
and has more DTMF commands by default.
It's only built on RaspberryPI.
The [985 group](https://w3gmsrepeater.com/)
has been circulating
some new tutorials based on HamVOIP.

[AllStarLink](https://allstarlink.org/)
is open-source,
and some DTMF codes need to be added.
It can be deployed on RaspberryPI or a computer.
AllStarLink makes the most sense
to me for my values.
