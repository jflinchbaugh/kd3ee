Uploading to http://pota.app/ from a phone
can be difficult sometimes,
but I found a way to do it.

- Export from POLO to Google Drive
- In the mobile browser,
  zoom out just a little and turn the phone sideways
  to get pota.app to allow you to upload.
  - make the zoom adjustment in chrome.
  - alternatively, switch to desktop mode,
    but then you need to adjust back
- _Download_ the ADI file from Google Drive
  to local `Downloads` folder,
  then upload to pota.app.
  If you don't download it,
  you'll see a network error in pota.app.
