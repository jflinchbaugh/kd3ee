I've been curious about the
[T2LT "flower pot" antenna](https://hamradiodx.net/easy-to-build-2-meter-146-mhz-vertical-antenna/)
for a while.
It's fed from the bottom
and attached to a sturdy PVC pole.
I can easily hoist it into a tree,
and it has a low wind load,
so it could go on top of a flag pole again.

I built it
at the SPARC Elmer night
from some 75-ohm TV cable I had laying around.
I taped and cable-tied it to a thin bit of PVC,
and I adapted the feed point
from 75ohm TV cable connector to SMA.
I had built it long to allow tuning,
but it tested to be just about right
for 146MHz when I put the VNA on it.
