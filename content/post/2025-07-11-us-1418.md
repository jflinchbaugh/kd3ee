When activating
[US-1418](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1418),
Sam Lewis,
I accidentally split the activation
across 0000 UTC.
Fortunately,
I still got enough for the second day.
I found some of my chokes broken,
so swapped cable around a bit.
I threw the 40M EFHW into a tree,
and got 12 contacts, on FT8, on 15M and 40M.
