I have the new Pixel 10 Pro XL,
so I needed to setup Winlink again.
I purchased WOAD
this time from Play store,
and signed up for access to the beta.
Previously,
I had installed the downloaded APK.
One can export sessions from old WOAD,
but there's no way to import it
into my new phone.

I'm having trouble getting a node
that reliably does Winlink.
K3IR seems to fail to connect
and complete the transaction.
I could use the BBS nodes
at KA3TKW and W3CRS.
Just watching packets
on `145.010` shows some advertisements
of services on nodes: Winlink, BBS, and mail
