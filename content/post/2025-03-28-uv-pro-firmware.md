I've been learning
about the BTech UV-Pro.
When scannimg,
it degrades the incoming APRS,
even in digital mode where it checks back
to the APRS channel frequently.
I've been using stock APRSdroid
over the TNC connection,
but it takes a little fiddling sometimes
to get it to connect.

In the new firmware,
they've been flip-flopping features between 8.2.x and 8.3.
It has bold/yellow fonts (or not),
and new button actions to access groups.
NOAA alerts have also come and gone
to see about RX performance
