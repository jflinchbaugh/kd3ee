I found I can mute
the dedicated APRS channel
on my Btech UV-Pro
to never make a sound,
so I can listen to the 2 dual-watch channels
without needing to hear digital squawks.

The UV-Pro already had a feature
to mute what it recognizes as digital signals,
but that always takes a moment to activate it.
I don't know how that's useful at all.

The RT-880G has this feature,
and it got me thinking
and reading manuals.
