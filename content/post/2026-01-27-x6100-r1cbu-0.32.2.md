### Upgrade

I upgraded to
[R1CBU 0.32.2](https://github.com/gdyuldin/x6100_gui/releases/tag/v0.32.2).
It tested fine with WSJT-X.

It has a new IF-shift feature
to move birdies in the menu, 
but it was "unavailable"
on the old base firmware I was running,
so I had to upgrade to Base 1.1.9:
- https://www.radioddity.com/pages/xiegu-download
- write the image to an SD card
- boot it
- let it restart
- apply the base 1.1.9 upgrade from the system / firmware menu
  on the stock firmware

Upgrading the base to 1.1.9 went OK
after figuring out some issues
with a bad `/dev/sdb` device handle
on my Linux notebook.

### New Features

Now I can "IF Shift"
when I find a birdie near
or in the passband I'm trying to hear.
It binds nicely to the bottom MFK
for quick access.

This firmware continues to work for FT8.
I tested power output with CW as well,
since there was a note
about needing to applying an output gain.

It's nice to see the discrete values
from the graphs also on the screen:
received signal, TX power, SWR.

I've been experimenting for a while with 2 stop bits in `flrig`
to get the initial connection to succeed more often.
Sometimes it helps, and sometimes it doesn't.
I was hoping this update may help,
but there's no difference.
I'll go back to 1 stop bit.
