### My Week in Radio
- I have a blog of my radio notes,
  but I've fallen behind by over a month in posting.
- Tested a rybakov antenna with 4:1 balun and 25-foot wire out at a park.
- Btech UV-PRO (for APRS) has been seeing lots of beta firmware updates
- Attended a lunch with a Harrisburg 21 repeater group
  to learn about beacons and online tools for radio conditions
- My second 2M antenna (slim-jim) was performing badly
  - hanging next to the feed line of the higher antenna,
    and it was completely de-tuning it
  - pulled it up into the tree on its own line to provide space
  - still hangs lower than the other antenna to avoid interference
- contestcalendar.com has a google calendar feed,
  which i've imported to my calendar, so no more date math to figure out UTC

### Others
- W8CRW, CR:
  - updated phone software, so allstar node is working.
- W3JAM, Jeff:
  - on digital to avoid connecting to anything on the roof in the storm
  - simplex net from the shack
    - always observing conditions on 2M
    - ducting
    - heard lots of distant stations, but not close
    - worked 50 miles across lancaster county
    - switched between vertical and horizontal: horizontal was better sometimes
    - new diamond antenna to install
    - swapping out everything on the shack
- NA3CW, Chuck:
  - hosting AWA pre-net
  - working on Joe's tuner project: crimp connectors for components
- KC3OOK, Bill:
  - out in the truck to operate in the weather
  - mobile simplex net, south control
    - copied all but maybe 3 stations
- KV3JGB, Matt:
  - new parts, a choke, for the HF radio
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - visited a friend's barn of parts for 1929 hartley oscillator
  - triton 4 didn't turn on for CW sked:
    bad power supply, so switched to battery
- WA3KFT, John:
  - 100W RF to get through
  - new bracket on the tower
  - modifications for being able to tilt down the antenna.
- WA3VEE, Ron:
  - testing an IC-9700: working nicely
    - right on frequency
    - no harmonics
    - full power on every band
    - all configured
  - mud mosey for those helping, April 12, contact KC3TMT for info
- AA3LH, Leon:
  - back from weather events
  - in trailblazer, installed a new dual-band VHF/UHF radio
  - ran some 2M nets, but missed simplex net
  - 80M: rooster net and bible study net

### Questions
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - AICO audio generator:
    - 2 tubes, precision resistors
    - wein bridge oscillator
    - siren like, but it varies on 15 second interval
    - what component failure causes the variation
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - check for a ripple from the power supply
    - sounded like a beating with the output
    - warble may vary with frequency
    - wein bridge oscillator was the first product of hewlett packard
  - WA3KFT, John:
    - check B+ voltage from the power supply and at the tube
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - looking at the schematic
    - uses a lightbulb to stabilize based on temperature
    - check the tubes and check that lightbulb
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - the lightbulb may not light, but it'll use cold resistance of the tube
    - check continuity
    - if the power supply is giving ripple, the capacitor is bad
