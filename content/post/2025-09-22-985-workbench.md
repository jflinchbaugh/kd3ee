### Questions
- AB3AP, Mike:
  - Winter Field Day sounds like it is 20-25WPM,
    and that'll be comfortable.
    Faster requires lots of extra listens.
    What are others' comfortable speeds?
  - W3DIB: 0
  - AF3Z:
    - keyers set to 35wpm, spacing is usually wider.
    - 20-25wpm is more comfortable
    - try to get contact info before the call
  - W3DIB, Greg: N2HM, Bob is amazing to watch
  - KB3ILS, Keith:
    - don't worry about speed on WFD. people will slow if you need.
    - just skip people who go too fast.
    - working closer to 20wpm will get you more contacts
    - managed first straight key contact at about 6wpm at last field day
    - "we'll help you copy, just try"
  - WA3KFT, John:
    - passed test with 13wpm for advanced
    - no longer that fast, out of practice
    - taught code in classes
    - first learned it in boy scouts
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - slower, took 2 attempts to pass 13wpm
    - 15-18 today
  - KD3EE, John:
    - morsle.fun: 25-30wpm if i can hear it multiple times
    - keyer at 20wpm, but leaving some space
    - I'll hope to get help copying at field day
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - flags in boy scouts
    - passed 13wpm in 1967
    - barely passed 20wpm in 1979
    - practicing with a sked qso
    - 35wpm seems impossible, but he's getting there
    - being retired gives him time to practice
  - W3DIB, Greg:
    - lcwo.net
  - KB3ILS, Keith:
    - use computer programs
    - also just listen to others' QSOs on 40m
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - use a websdr to listen
  - KD3EE, John:
    - ARRL code practice files and podcast
  - KB3ZIM, Bob:
    - hearing signals from south pacific right now on HF
    - practiced and learned at 59 years
    - always intended to use it
    - bought the CW paddle before a transceiver
    - doesn't want to inconvenience others
    - prosigns are baffling
    - practice sites don't necessarily demonstrate prosigns
    - seeing dots and dashes slowed us all down
  - KD3EE, John:
    - chase pota to practice CW
  - KB3ILS, Keith:
    - relayed my message, and recommended spotting from pota.app.
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - SKCC hangs out on +50khz and events, so good to listen there
    - simple exchanges
    - don't do CW if you don't like it.
- KD3APR, Paxton:
  - Seeing some repeaters offering "auto-patch". How's that work,
    and how's it sound?
  - W3DIB, Greg:
    - Univ Del had an autopatch.
    - you'd need to get permission and get the code to be able to use it.
    - it would place the phone call.
    - it would leave the TX up the whole time the phone was on.
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - it's been years.
    - other person would need to know to say "over" since the carrier
      stayed up even when remote is transmitting,
      and on one would otherwise know when the other person stops
    - got to use it once in the 70s to call for road help
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - needed to remind the phone side
      that the communication is being transmitted
    - don't do business.
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - you just can't use the radio for your boss, "under ordrers".
    - running a business vs doing a transaction.
- KB3ZIM, Bob:
  - Is autopatch still used and offered?
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - repeater book lists autopatch as a service on some repeaters
  - W3DIB, Greg:
    - it's probably easy in the time of VOIP.
