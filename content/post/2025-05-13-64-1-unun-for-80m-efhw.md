Today I experimented
with building a 64:1 unun
for an 80-meter EFHW.

My initial attempt involved 3 primary / 24 secondary windings,
but I quickly found that this took up too much space
on the small toroid I was using.

After some adjustments,
I settled on a 2 primary / 16 secondary windings,
adding a 100pF capacitor.
This configuration was inspired
by resources like
[KM1NDY's DIY linked EFHW 64:1 antenna guide](https://km1ndy.com/diy-linked-efhw-64-to-1-antenna/).

I'm now successfully running my home EFHW antenna
on 40 meters without needing a tuner.
On 17 meters,
the SWR is a bit high,
so I engage the tuner for that band.

This setup reminds me a lot
of my previous 71-foot random wire antenna
with a 9:1 balun.
I'm noticing a significant increase
in the number of signals I'm receiving,
which suggests this new EFHW might be a considerable improvement
over my old 107-foot EFRW.
