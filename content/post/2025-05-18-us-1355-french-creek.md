I visited [French Creek State Park (US-1355)](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1355).

I deployed my 40-meter EFHW,
strung up into a convenient tree.
I operated with low power,
typically between 1-2 watts,
on the 10-meter,
40-meter,
and 20-meter bands.

I primary operated FT8,
and I also attempted some PSK,
but no one responded.
