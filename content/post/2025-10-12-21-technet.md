### My Week in Radio
- traveling:
  - cruise ships specifically forbid ham radios
  - practiced copying some CW
- listened to a little PA QSO party, but didn't participate
- 21 has been lower power recently,
  - wondering if it's my multiple antennas
    or the repeaters
  - definitely at least one feed line problem diagnosed
    during this net

  - repeater power
  - when no double beep,
    then the repeater is putting out full power: 115W
  - when it's beeping, the power is low: 20W.
