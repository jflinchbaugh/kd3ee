I activated [US-8843](https://pota.app/#/park/US-8843),
State Game Land 145.
I got 9 QSOs
before day change (at 2W-4W)
and another 18 QSOs
after day change (at 6W).
I setup the tactical delta loop,
and grounded the black side
that passes through the toroid.
The feed is the red side.
It tuned nicely at about 1.5:1
on 20m and 40m.
It was slow going at 2-4W,
but I was being seen in PSKreporter.
