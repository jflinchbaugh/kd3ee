I loaded the
[nicsure 5.14.01 firmware](https://www.patreon.com/posts/nicfw880-v5-14-149784888)
from the patreon
onto my RadTel RT-880G.
It changed storage stucture,
so I needed to do a factory reset before installing.
I found the RMS software does weird things
importing chirp files
or reading from the radio.
I needed to sort out erroneous CTS codes, reverses, etc in the RMS.

The radio is receiving APRS really well off the outside antenna,
and I'm seeing lots of good decodes.
