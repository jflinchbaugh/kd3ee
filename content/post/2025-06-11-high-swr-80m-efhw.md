I was seeing high SWR
on the 80M EFHW: over 3:1+.
I found counterpoise was chewed and broken,
so I twisted it back together,
but I saw no change.
I disconnected the counterpoise completely,
and that made no difference: still 3:1.
I finally unscrewed and re-screwed
the rusty alligator clamp and reattached it.
That fixed it!

Previously,
it seemed I'd sometimes see high SWR
for a a moment,
then it would recover.
It seemed like giving it a little power would "clean up" something.
