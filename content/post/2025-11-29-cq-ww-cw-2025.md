For this year's [CQ Worldwide CW](https://cqww.com/) contest
I heard KH6J from Hawaii on 40M,
but I couldn't contact them.
Locals weren't worth anything except for unique CQ zones as multipliers.
I kept it to 5W
and made 20 contacts on CW.
I turned up to send 25wpm,
since everyone was going so fast.

I still rely on the excellent decoder in the R1CBU radio UI,
but I've been practicing reading CW too.
