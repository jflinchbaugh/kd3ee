I've paid for the [Nicsure Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/nicsure/posts)
to get access to his new firmware for the Radtel RT-880G,
and I've used his Linux CPS to flash it and load channels.

Having a Linux CPS alone is an amazing enhancement.
The UI is not necessarily intuitive compared to other radios,
but I'm getting accustomed to it.
Most the functions I want from the menu are found
by long-pressing the green button,
and it shows you the shortcut key you could use.
There are also posts about an extended manual
that helps a bit,
but I still found mismatches.

I have it beaconing APRS and receiving,
but it still struggles to get a good decode.
The stock firmware shows garbage decodes,
but his one just doesn't show anything for those failures.

It seems to have nice scanning, HF receive, and the spectrum analyzer.
