The slim jim
I put up
for APRS was hanging
right next to the feed line
of the higher quarter-wave antenna
I use for local analog traffic.
The feed line was de-tuning the slim jim,
so reception of APRS traffic was almost non-existent.
I could swap the antennas and the higher one worked much better,
and the lower slim jim was greatly degraded for other FM traffic.
Usually the BTech is on the lower slim jim,
and the Quansheng is scanning on the higher quarter-wave.

To correct the problem,
I pulled the 2 antennas
up on separate ropes
and separated them by a couple feet.
The quarter-wave is still mounted higher
than the slim jim.
