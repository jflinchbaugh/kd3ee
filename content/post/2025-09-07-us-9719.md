[US-9719](https://pota.app/#/park/US-9719) Susquehanna Riverlands.
- 40m mostly, 10m, 2W, FT8
- 40m CW, 5W
- KD3EE is very nice for CW
- Gabil whip with sliding coil is great
- CA, MX, VA, NC, OH, etc
- I was seeing interference on the touchpad,
  so reintroduced the choke at the feed point,
  and that fixed it.
- I had removed the choke,
  thinking I could use the coax
  as another counterpoise.
