I ran out to Sam Lewis, {{<hamlink pota="US-1418">}},
to activate when the rain stopped.

I took a few minutes
to setup my normal EFHW running North-South
to operate more to the East and West,
though I did get a contact to Colombia.

I operated mostly low-power FT8, 1-4W, but mostly 2W.
I chased and got 1 CW contact
before it started getting cold and dark.
