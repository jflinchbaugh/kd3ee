I purchased a [USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN4L1NBY)
to connect my CW paddles (1/8-inch audio plug) to the computer.
I can now use [Vband on-line chat](https://hamradio.solutions/vband/)
to practice keying CW with other people.

The adapter simulates Left and Right Ctrl keys
with the morse key,
and the website interprets that
as _dits_ and _dahs_.
It works really well.

I also found [Morse Invaders](https://morseinvaders.com/tx/#),
which is a typing tutor that uses CW:
key the word before it hits your city.

Minor Linux Note:
I use `keyd` to remap
some keys on my laptop,
so be aware how it may
[mess with the Ctrl Keys](https://www.hjsoft.com/blog/2026/IdeaPad_CW_Keyd.html).
