### My Week in Radio
- Winter Field Day
  - I logged for CW ops and listened along
  - I could hear 2-3 characters at a time
### Others
- {{<qrz W8CRW>}}, CR:
  - Field Day
- {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
  - Field Day
    - operated most
    - worked N3FJP, author of the software
    - {{<qrz W1AW>}}
    - {{<qrz W2AEW>}} see on youtube
    - worked with Kianna
- {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
  - field day trailer worked out great
- {{<qrz KB3PZY>}}, Al:
  - first field day
  - Thanks Harvey for mentoring
  - 30 some contacts
- {{<qrz KB3ILS>}}, Keith:
  - antennas up at the field day site
  - got to WFD early
  - laptops, network, power worked great
  - 450-475 contacts made
  - SKCC
    - PR on 6M CW
    - Alaska on 15M CW
- {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
  - WFD with another club, 75M
    - didn't hear anyone in the afternoon, all noise
    - early evening it lit up
- {{<qrz KC3OOK>}}, Bill:
  - simplex net
  - welfare net
- {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
  - welcome Al
  - antenna install for WFD with lots of people
  - "how to cut a dipole the second time, every time" worked pretty well
  - used Joe's tuner with 100W testing
  - PMAM pre-net
- {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
  - SKCC month ends on saturday
    - coordinating SKCC ops, had enough of it :)
    - worked 240 contacts with special callsign
  - worked WFD with cornwall station
    - proved total lid
      - operated a Elecraft K3 on 40M
      - heard W3R, but couldn't get an answer
      - K3 needs VOX enabled for CW, so it wasn't transmitting
      - quit for the morning
      - realized much later about VOX
- {{<qrz AA3LH>}}, Leon:
  - winter field day at home: 40M and 80M
*** Questions
- {{<qrz KD3EE>}}, John:
  - What was the problem with the 80M antennas and that radio that rebooted?
  - How significant is the dipole arrangement (flat vs inverted-v)
    to multi-station operation?
  - {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
    - originally thought it was RF
    - switched radio to AC-DC power supply, and then the radio was fine
    - trailers battery may not have kept up with the severe cold
    - new radio couldn't tolerate voltage drop, but older radio was ok
    - LiFEPo battery struggles under 30F
    - CW dipole showed high SWR at one spot, still needed to be investigated more
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - when the weather is better,
      Ron will run a complete analysis
      on each antenna on the site.
    - we can talk inductance and capacitance then
    - there seems to be an RFI problem from a power transformer insulator
      up there as well
  - {{<qrz KB3ILS>}}, Keith:
    - 80M dipole cut for sideband worked well
    - 40M CW in the corner may need some work
    - 1 beam was pointing at the 80M dipole, so likely caused lots
      interference
    - it'll be good to analyze when no one transmitting
    - one 40M dipole may be close to noise.
    - some experimenting to do
    - we still got lots of 40M contacts
  - {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
    - power-line interference has been an ongoing issue
    - Chuck has a small moxon for 137MHz that will be good paired
      with AM on his HT to search for the noise source
      - worked to find a bad pole in his neighborhood
    - inverted vs flat dipole
      - dipoles end to end have very little radiation off the ends.
      - inverted-v antennas would have seen each other on the ends
      - analyzers work with very low signals,
        so would have totally been skewed by nearby QRN and TX
  - {{<qrz KB3ILS>}}, Keith:
    - Chuck, let's build a dipole curtain array for field day.
- {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
  - HF vertical can have a ground plane, even in the air or on the ground?
    They help control common-mode current? Why use them?
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - the ground plane is the other half of your antenna.
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - Has the Amtron A99 on a tower without the ground plane kit,
      but has a TV mast below it on the tower, so may be serving the purpose.
  - {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
    - IMAC 2000 antenna, 50 ft in the air without the ground plane kit.
      The galvanized steel mast underneath it served as the ground.
    - AMTRON 99 came with it, so he installed it. It looks cool.
  - {{<qrz AA3LH>}}, Leon:
    - Used tuned hamsticks in Colorado,
      and put out lots of radials.
  - {{<qrz KD3EE>}}, John:
    - the computer and radio going wonky (touchpad, USB, etc)
      always remind me when I need to add radials to my vertical antenna.
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - With the IMAC, he knows he needs the ground plane kit as it gets higher
      in the air.
    - His is grounded to a gas pipe, so it seems to work pretty well,
      and he's gotten to Australia.
    - Also has lots of coax to absorb it.
    - Has gotten to Australia with it.
- {{<qrz KD3BPI>}}, Simon:
  - He's planning for antennas on the house, 2 stories, walk-up attic.
    He has a dormer facing west, and was planning to mount antennas there.
    Easy to get to them from attic.
    Can he mount all the antennas on one plate or should he space them out?
    - regional HF (20m) antenna and dual-band 2m/70cm antenna.
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - Personally doesn't like to have antenna on the house,
      since it draws lightning.
    - How much land?
      - Simon: L-shaped, 1/3 acre, but no trees that are actually his.
    - 40M would be a good horizontal wire for regional NVIS
    - grounding is imperative for lightning protection of the house.
    - those antennas, in size, are very different.
    - wires are easier for HF
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - the Hustler 5-BTV for 80-10M is a good option
    - he has radio and tuner for Simon
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - Hustler in the yard would be a good option
    - pin down the feed line and radials with lawn stakes
    - neighbors trees: any limbs over your property could be used to hold
      up an end fed antenna
    - get the antenna as high as you can get it
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - He has 5 antennas at the top of a tower, like a candlabra.
    - an edger is good for grooving the lawn for wires
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - sent link to the Hustler 5-BTV
    - the digital modes are FT8 and PSK31
  - {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
    - Has an NMO lip-mount with dual band antenna clamped
      to the rain gutter of the shop.
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - using a copper pipe j-pole inside in the attic of the garage.
      - should work just fine.
    - an HF antenna in the attic would work fine too
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - for new hams and those in HOAs,
      attic antennas can be effective
  - {{<qrz W8CRW>}}, CR:
    - Why's the 5-BTV so highly recommended, compared to other variations?
    - WA3VEE, Ron:
      - the 5 walks the line of versatility and size
      - they're different sizes
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - a 4-BTV is 4-bands, 5- is 5-band, etc.
  - {{<qrz KA3GLI>}}, David:
    - on the 5-BTV, what auto-tuner is recommended?
    - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
      - LDG RC-1 auto-tuner helps match as you get away from the vertical's
        narrow, high-Q, resonant spot.
  - {{<qrz KD3EE>}}, John:
    - remember you can build these HF antennas with some wire and toroids.
- {{<qrz KD3BPI>}}, Simon:
  - How does height affect performance of a vertical: ground vs roof?
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - wire radials on the ground are easy. detuned by the earth.
    - lots of short radials are best
    - elevated radials will perform better, but will require tuning of radials.
    - random lengths are fine on the ground
  - {{<qrz KC3WRY>}}, Matt:
    - a ground-mounted antenna is easier to tune, instead of up in the air.
    - ground-mounted can always later be moved.
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - worked at an AM radio station.
    - when they moved, they rebuilt all the radials.
      - 60 short and 60 long radials
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - 8 radials with the 5-BTV at the beach was fine
    - gains aren't as impressive after the first radials
