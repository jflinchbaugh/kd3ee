{{<pota US-4567>}}, Capt John Smith Chesapeake Trail,
stretches from New York to the Chesapeake Bay
following the Susquehanna River,
so that means we can activate from any public land
within 100ft of the river.
I drove from Turkey Hill to Bainbridge evaluating spots along the river:
- Riverfront park in Columbia would be nice
- The boat launch on south side of Marietta has a nice bit of beach.
- The park on the north side of Marietta is a bit too busy,
  but did have a nice area of grass and trees.
- I setup at the Riverfront park in Bainbridge.

I threw the EFHW
into an inverted-V
in tree and back down to a bench.
I worked SSB first
for some park-to-park activations,
and then switched to FT8 on 40m.
