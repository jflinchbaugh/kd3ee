I got WINE setup to run the software for RadTel.
I had to install Mono for Windows inside WINE
to make the RadTel CPS and Flasher work:

I also got serial going:

The APRS support on the RadTel RT-880G
still seems a bit broken, though.
I keep seeing a stray character in the path: "WIDE1_-1"
Setting the path in CPS software had the same problem.
Setting the path to " WIDE1" makes it show OK in packets.
