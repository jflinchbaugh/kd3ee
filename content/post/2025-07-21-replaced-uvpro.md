I got the BTech UV-PRO back on Friday, 2025-07-18.
This one has a different serial number,
so very quick replacement.
I restored the configuration
from the HT app on my phone.
The new radio is seen
on https://aprs.fi/ again
and I occasionally see APRSDroid report
that it's been digipeated by a nearby node.
I tested the transmit power to be 4.8W
with the small meter.
Power was previously not detected at all by the meter.
