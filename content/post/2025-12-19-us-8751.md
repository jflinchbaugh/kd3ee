I activated {{< pota US-8751>}}, State Game Land 52.
I deployed the speaker-wire doublet again
in an inverted-V
to operate 1W
on 20M.
It ran NW-SE,
and I used the 4:1 _and_ a 1:1 current balun
on the coax.
It tuned well in 20m, and caused no USB disconnects!
My 1W FT8 signal was heard in France and Spain.

The Evolve 3 keyboard had some dead keys: w t.
It doesn't seem I can fix that,
so it may need to be replaced.
