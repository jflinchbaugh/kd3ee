### My Week in Radio
- muted the APRS channel on my UV-PRO,
  so I don't need to hear that squawking away
  - there is an option to mute digital,
    but it only works when it recognizes it's digital
- been testing a doublet built from:
  - a split speaker wire,
  - 44ft end to end
  - a 4:1 balun
  - choke balun
  - 30 FT8 contacts on 20M at 1W for a park activation
- 80M EFHW today for better receive to place 21.6M-long EFRW
- worked contests:
  - [PSK Fest](https://www.podxs070.com/o7o-club-sponsored-contests/pskfest):
    15 contacts
  - [RTTY Roundup](https://www.arrl.org/rtty-roundup): 70 contacts
- gave one of Tom's cool little ATS radios to a friend's kid,
  get him bitten by the bug
