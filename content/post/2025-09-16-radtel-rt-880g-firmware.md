The Radtel RT-880G got new firmware yesterday: 1.16.
I had to run the upgrade software in WINE.

- APRS occasionally receives a message that PASSES the FCS check,
  but still mostly failed,
  and some are completely garbled chinese characters.
- TX APRS looks pretty good now.
  I've seen on BTech UV-PRO
  and on https://aprs.fi/.
- Listening to "Radio" mode is cool:
  20M CW, FT8, and a little voice.
- The menus are pretty confusing,
  and it's hard to remember the controls,
  especially in "Radio".
- I was using the radio in "Full Band Tuning",
  but it causes problems in spectrum mode,
  so I went back to normal mode.
