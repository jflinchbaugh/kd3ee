### My Week in Radio
- gifted a tiny HF radio receiver to a friend's kid
  - whip, loop, + wire antenna I added.
  - listening is how I ended up licensed.
### Others
- {{<qrz K3KB>}}, Alan:
  - cleaning out old gear to maybe move
    - RC airplanes
    - test gear
    - kits
    - very old HTs
    - will bring to next breakfast
- {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
  - working on Joe's tuner: about to power up
- {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
  - 10M CW sked
  - very few signals otherwise
  - heard a solid CQ
    - on at 8000ft mountain in mexico
    - heard {{<qrz JM7OLW>}} (Japan), and got it finally
    - 6pm on 10M
- {{<qrz KC3OOK>}}, Bill:
  - ham shack is about finished
- {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
  - got a new wire up in the air
  - all bands were open for testing: 6M-40M
- {{<qrz KV3JGB>}}, Matt:
  - working some HF
  - new CWOps academy class
- {{<qrz KD3AIS>}}, Tim:
  - listening to HF while doing other work
- {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
  - 28435khz 1pm-2pm retired net
    - contacted OK, TX
### Questions
- {{<qrz K3OU>}}, Manny:
  - building his shack from zero, looking at 2 transceivers:
    - Yaesu FT-DX10 (hybrid SDR)
    - ICOM 7300 Mk2 (SDR)
  - which performs best?
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - using 7300 for 5 years
    - lots of features he's not used
    - has an ATU
    - uses an amplifier with it sometimes
    - likes it
  - {{<qrz K3KB>}}, Alan:
    - had an IC-7300 for a while
    - doesn't use the ATU, uses external instead
    - what do you mean by performance?
  - {{<qrz K3OU>}}, Alan:
    - reception performance:
      - receiving weak signals
      - rejecting side signals
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - both rigs are top-tier
    - IC-7300 is intuitive to Harvey, so never read the manual
    - play with both UIs to see what you like
    - ease of use may be more important than performance
    - HRO has them available for demo
  - {{<qrz KA3GLI>}}, David:
    - download each manual and spec sheet for comparisons
  - {{<qrz WA8CRW>}}, CR:
    - FTDX10 has better specs
  - {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
    - Radios sound differently, so you want to hear it connected to an antenna
    - IC-710 sounded nice at field day to Chuck
    - Kenwoods sound nice to Chuck
    - some may be better for DX or general use
  - {{<qrz KC3OOK>}}, Bill:
    - Will any of those be at WFD?
    - Be careful reading only specs, some specs can be misleading
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - looked at output of 7300. sending smugmug link
    - Ron has both radios and will bring them to WFD.
    - there should be more there
    - FTDX10 has an external display port
      - IC-7300 didn't have it
      - IC-7300 Mk 2 may have it
    - FTDX10 has a wider spectrum display
    - IC-7300 is a well-featured "starter" rig
      - FTDX10 has more features
    - look up sherwood engineering for comparisons
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - settling on a rig's UI is a lot like picking a car.
      - drive it before buying it
    - .1uV difference will not be perceivable: it's in the noise
    - all rigs are pretty good
    - visit someone and test drive their rigs
    - IC-7300 seems like great bang for the buck
    - don't get hung up on specs
    - roofing filters are a great feature when operating multiple rigs
    - kenwoods have great audio
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - 5 years
    - spectrum scope is the #1 reason to buy it: expandable to analyze a signal
  - {{<qrz K3OU>}}, Alan:
    - thanks for all the advice, especially test driving at field day
    - hasn't been on an HF rig since 80s
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - use different audio presets between rag chewing and contesting
  - {{<qrz K3OU>}}, Alan:
    - not going to contest, just chat
- {{<qrz KD3AIS>}}, Tim:
  - Looking at band plan,
    why and how do people use the really high microwave frequencies
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - people will use a 10M radio to drive a transverter
      and parabolic antenna
    - higher frequencies may be useful for satellite
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - has seen 5GHz and 10GHz operations
    - very line-of-sight, maybe from summits
  - {{<qrz KC3OOK>}}, Bill:
    - IC-905 does those bands
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - for experimentation
    - there are local people active on 1.2GHz
    - much smaller antennas and dishes
- {{<qrz KD3EMS>}}, Chris:
  - What would be more secure for the church than using FRS? DMR?
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - look into MURS, it'll at least not be as common
    - it may allow base stations
  - {{<qrz KD3EE>}}, John:
    - you may want to contact a commercial radio dealer to get setup
      on a licensed business frequency
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - DMR would be more complicated to setup
  - {{<qrz W3GMS>}}, Joe:
    - contact Metropolitan Communication for commercial setup and coordination
  - {{<qrz KD3EMS>}}, Chris:
    - Triangle Communications in New Holland is nearby
