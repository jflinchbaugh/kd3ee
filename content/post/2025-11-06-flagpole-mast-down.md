The flagpole mast broke in the wind about 9:05pm EST or so.
I [captured the destruction](https://youtu.be/yaA2J9-tIa0?si=8ErQ_wCDf1WfzSYE)
on the Wyze camera that watches it.
It snapped right above the point it's tied to the garage.
Fortunately, it fell in an OK direction,
so it didn't damage anything around it.

I could try to put it back up with some spare pieces
and guy it next time,
or I could try the military surplus mast
I picked up at a Ham Fest this past summer.

I'll be contacting the [985 repeater](https://w3gmsrepeater.com/)
digitally through [Allstar](/tags/allstarlink/) for now.
