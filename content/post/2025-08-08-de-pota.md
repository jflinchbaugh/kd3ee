One morning, I headed to Delaware
to have lunch
and to activate [US-1730](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1730),
Alapocas Run State Park.
It was also along
[US-9878](https://pota.app/#/park/US-9878),
Northern Delaware Greenway National Recreation Trail.

I put up my homebrew delta loop with 4:1 balun.
With the tuner on the X6100, I could get 1.5:1 SWR
on 20M.
For kicks,
I only ran 1W
and made 23 contacts calling CQ
on FT8.
The location was very quiet for listening.

On 15M, I got Italy with 1W.

I tested a new 5200mAh 12V Li-Ion battery,
and it worked for the entire activation.
It dropped from 12.3V to 10.9V or so
which was plenty for the radio.
