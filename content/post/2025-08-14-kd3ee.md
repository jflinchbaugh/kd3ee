You may have seen that the name
of this blog changed from KC3WWC
to KD3EE, shorter, snappier, lighter-weight callsign
to say phonetically and to key in CW.

In changing my callsign, I made a lot of work for myself updating things:
- QRZ.com notified me first, and had me start a new logbook
- Echolink
- Blog name: DNS, Apache, SSL certificates, redirects from the old name, 
  CI/CD, Github repo name.
- LOTW: requested a new cert and all that -- Done in a day thankfully.
- Name on 2 Quanshengs
- Callsign in APRS radios: BTech, RadTel
- Allstar node
- Name tag I made in LibreOffice Draw.
- Pota.app website
- Hamalert
- WSJT-X
- Gridtracker has lots of logins: new api key for new QRZ logbook.
- Update everything again on the field laptop
- Aprsdroid
- Ham2K Polo on my phone
- Practice saying it and keying it.
