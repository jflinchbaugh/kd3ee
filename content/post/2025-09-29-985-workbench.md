### Week in Radio
- Welcome manny!
- Attended the 3D Printing show in Belair on Saturday
- activated a new-to-me park in MD
- WW RTTY contest
  - 66 contacts, QRP, Rookie
- leaving on a cruise on saturday:
  - no ham radios
  - will miss Red Rose Hamfest

### Others
- W3JAM, Jeff:
  - Skywarn in Dauphin county
  - Simplex Net
  - OCF antenna finally installed
  - 2m antenna mounted higher
  - received a 16 element yagi to refurbish
- AC3NW, Manny:
  - new extra license in January
  - building a shack
  - running coax outside
  - working on getting operational in general: VHF and HF
  - looking to install a vertical for VHF and dipole for HF
  - budget
- WA3VEE, Ron:
  - getting ready for Red Rose Hamfest
    - testing some scopes and power supplies
  - setting up his military station
- KC3RFG, Jim:
  - fixing up an antenna and its connections, so radio will tune better
    - replaced a lightning arrester
- WA3KFT, John:
  - hearing some other traffic in his location on 985
  - advice: always have an SWR meter in the coax line to keep an eye on things.
  - reading high SWR on current 2M rig
- KC3OOK, Bill:
  - hosted welfare net on sunday
  - working at joe's on tower
    - final install this weekend
- KC3SQI, Wayne:
  - working on his feed lines on tower
  - attempted to check-in to the old forks net on Saturday
    - but found Puerto Rico and Scotland instead,
      so made those contacts
  - hula hoop antenna on top of tower
  - evaluating performance and noise of different antennas he has up
  - noise from air conditioner unit
  - one more antenna to move, and then they're all on the same mast
- AB3AP, Mike:
  - CW and POTA contacts
  - playing with PLL to track broadcast AM modulation
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - found the rtty contest
  - 7030kHz, found the FOC CW party there
    - worked some of them
    - 2 UK, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, US
    - exchange: signal report and name + FOC number
- KD3AIS, Tim:
  - another week waiting for an antenna bracket for the 2024 Tundra
    - keep getting the wrong bracket
- KB3ZIM, Bob:
  - more 10M activity
  - worked a 6m repeater in Honey Brook: K3CX?
    - linked to other repeaters
    - enjoying morsle.fun: very helpful, 40wpm
- AA3LH, Leon:
  - playing with a receiver on the long wire again:
    China, Russia

### Questions
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - With surface mount, integrated circuits, chips
    in modern rigs, how repairable do we think they'll be?
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - surface mount requires specialized equipment for soldering
    - swap whole boards
    - send it for repair
  - W8CRW, CR:
    - shipped a radio back for repair
    - parts sometimes aren't available for repair
    - obsolete
  - KD3EE, John:
    - Xiegu radios: my X6100 or G90
      - cheap, chinese
      - Radioddity sells a "refresh kit" with common parts
      - I have internal battery to swap in some day
    - updatable software means new features
      and optimizations in the future
    - is it like cars, where they don't _need_ repair as much?
  - KC3SQI, Wayne:
    - like TVs, some high power componests with heat sinks
      will still be replaceable
    - update-able firmware can extend the life
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - for icom rigs with burn-in problem, like ic-7610,
      repair turn-around is expected to be slow,
      but it got repaired quickly: 18 days turn-around.
    - updated firmware, totally refreshed, settings restored,
      replaced clock battery
    - great service from shop in MN
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - late 80s kenwood, never had anything wrong with it.
    - can deal with some surface mount
    - flashing may or may not be possible for replaced chips
    - never missed old car tech: more complex but less likely to fail
    - modifications to yaesu for external audio
      - days of work to make mods, so not accessible to most people
    - keeping rigs as long as possible
    - repairable: connectors, finals, power supplies
    - done with boat anchors
  - AB3AP, Mike:
    - old C64 computer had such a following
      there's an FPGA reproduction of it.
    - favorite old radios may be cloned, emulated,
      or new chips fabricated.
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - both his rigs have the original Motorola transistors
      that have been discontinued
    - ebay supposedly has equivalents (or fakes?)
    - other companies stepped up to make replacements
    - if there's demand there will be supply made available
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - ARRL had insurance for ham radio gear: preparation
    - amazed at longevity of solid-state gear:
      Triton IV since the 70s
    - computers with high clock speeds
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - labor is getting expensive: $1000 labor to install $7 part
    - SDR radios, like 7300 is 10 years old, and working well
    - 10 years is probably a good lifespan
    - with labor price, budgeting to buy replacement might be best
    - doesn't miss old car systems
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - they seldom commit suicide, but they sometimes get murdered
    - some new radios promise updates, but never deliver
