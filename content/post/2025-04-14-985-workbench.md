## My Week in Radio

* I spent some time patching the open-source firmware
  for my HF radio.
  The original modification aimed
  to center and save the ATU network on the current frequency,
  which is effective for about 25kHz in either direction.
  The system saves the tuning network settings
  into both a cache and the database.
  However, it needs to update nearby saved tunings.
  I noticed the radio would click in new tuning networks
  within 1 kHz of each other.
  After digging into the code,
  I found the error in how it cached these networks.

* Unfortunately, intermod hit every Monday,
  so I had to jump to Allstar,
  even though I had tested RF earlier in the week.

## Others

* **WA3VEE, Ron:** Discussed the Mud Mosey event.
* **W8CRW, CR:** Also mentioned the Mud Mosey.
* **AF3Z, Jim:** Had a CW sked.
* **NA3CW, Chuck:** Noted that the Mud Mosey operation sounded really good.
  Also discussed the AMPM net and propagation.
* **KC3OOK, Bill:** Participated in the Mud Mosey.
  Ron ran a net for people on their way
  in and out of the Mud Mosey service.
  Bill also served as net control
  for the simplex net
  and conducted a round table exercise
  to experiment with simplex.
* **KC3YSM, Steve:** Participated in the Mud Mosey
  for his first service operation.
* **KC3NZT, Harvey:** Listened to the roundtable.
* **W1RC, Mike:** Nearfest is coming up soon.
* **AA3LH, Leon:** Was on 10m last Tuesday,
  getting a 599 to Oregon,
  but then the signal dropped off completely.
  Later, he got a 599 to Los Angeles,
  but it also dropped off.
* **KB3ZIM, Bob:** Lots of mobile radio activity.
  Recent Chester County ARES/RACES meeting discussed revival of packet radio.
* **KC3YIG, Dave:** Struggling with building a vertical antenna.

## Questions

* **AA3LH, Leon:** If flat straps are recommended for grounding,
  would they also be good for a counterpoise?
  * **WA3VEE, Ron:** Flat straps control inductance.
    An electrical ground is fixed,
    but a counterpoise is often deployed
    and redeployed in the field,
    making it hard to keep flat.
  * **KC3NZT, Harvey:** Probably makes no difference.
    He used a strap in his car
    because it's cheap,
    and he's used cheap wire shelves in the grass
    as a ground plane for a vertical,
    attaching to it with a strap.
  * **AF3Z, Jim:** 
    Brought up the skin effect,
    where RF runs on the surface,
    not the middle.
    A strap may provide more surface area for RF.
  * **NA3CW, Chuck:**
    Frequency affects the depth
    of the skin effect.
    DC uses the entire conductor,
    60Hz uses almost the entire conductor,
    but on VHF/UHF frequencies,
    it will stay in a copper coating on aluminum
    (like in LMR400).
* **KC3NZT, Harvey:**
  Are there any FCC issues with recording and replaying as a relay,
  especially for emergency communications (EmComm).
  * **WA3VEE, Ron:** ARRL started with "relaying"
    and that he records and plays back to demonstrate reception,
    so it should be fine.
  * **NA3CW, Chuck:**
    Advised to just be careful not to sound like you're identifying
    as the other station.
