{{</gallery>}}
- at breakfast, I showed off a USB adapter to use a CW key on the computer
  to chat online or play video games to practice CW
  - I'm quickly improving my score as I practice.
- helped install antennas today at field day site
  - see the seasoned pros in action
  - afterward, I visited Micro Center,
    since I was relatively close

### Questions
- {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
  - Everyone checking in, sounded clear. WA3KFT, John, clicks in and out
    on his Anytone rig.
    Why?
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - 100W into the cable
  - {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
    - WA3KFT is badly deviated, needed to turn down audio when receiving.
  - {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
    - As Chuck said, WA3KFT, John is loud.
    - Can hear everything just fine, no cut-out,
      so that may be Mike's rig.
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - Mike, do you have the ability to set narrow/wide?
    - Delaware City UHF repeater exhibits clipping
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - has deviation set to wide
    - Yaesu hears John just fine.
    - AA3LH, Leon, is always loud, but OK.
  - {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
    - google that radio and the problem.
      there are settings to adjust to mitigate it
- {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
  - Does anyone have any experience working aurora on 6M?
    There's a flare coming tonight.
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - a couple years ago when solar cycle was lower, he made a few contacts.
  - More people should use 6M.
- {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
  - Has anyone heard anything much about the effecst
    of solar flares today around 1pm?
  - {{<qrz W3KZG>}}, Scott:
    - forums complaining about bands being totally dead, even up to 2M
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - 10M and 40M were noisy around 4pm
    - 80M has some people, and is pretty clean right now
  - {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
    - a K3Y operator was struggling to pull people out of noise
    - one station would be clear, then another like a spark hash
    - Jim heard warbling tones
- {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
  - Antennas were cut long, then installed, we tested, then adjusted.
    What's the formula for determining the amount to trim?
  - {{<qrz NA3CW>}}, Chuck:
    - SWR guesses were just good guesses.
    - For adjusting the length of the dipole:
      "tuning your dipole, second time, every time"
    - lots of things affect resonance:
      - height
      - quality of ground
      - insulation
      - wire velocity factor
    - to adjust:
      - measure before you put it up, while long
      - install it
      - measure where it resonates
      - corrected length / original length = desired freq / resonant freq
- {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
  - What QSL card services do you use for custom?
  - {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
    - KB3IFH prints cards, name tags, etc:
      https://www.kb3ifhqslcards.com/qsl-pricing-ordering
  - {{<qrz WA3KFT>}}, John:
    - Chester QSL Cards
    - plain, white, glossy
    - they advertise in QST
  - {{<qrz AA3LH>}}, Leon:
    - CheapQSLs.com
  - {{<qrz W3MFB>}}, Mike:
    - https://www.gigaparts.com/customizable-standard-3-5-x5-5-qsl-card.html
  - {{<qrz AF3Z>}}, Jim:
    - found software for designing the cards
      - interface with database or CSV
      - prepare all the cards at once
  - {{<qrz KC3NZT>}}, Harvey:
    - cheapqsls.com had multiple designs
  - {{<qrz WA3VEE>}}, Ron:
    - has used MS Publisher to layout cards
    - W3R cards look nice: yellow on dark
