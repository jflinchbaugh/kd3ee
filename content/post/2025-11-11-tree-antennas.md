Since the
[flagpole Yagi fell](/post/2025-11-06-flagpole-mast-down/),
and I'm not rushing to put it back up,
I figured I'd see if I can get my 2-meter antennas in the tree higher.

I threw the line up over the tree
to have it drop down the middle,
and I now pull the slim-jim antenna
up through the middle of the tree.
It's not the highest antenna,
above the ground-plane antenna.

I also took a moment to untangle the halyards and feed lines.
I looped the 2 feed lines
through a spring clip on the roof line
to keep them from slapping around so much.

I'm getting good APRS decodes off the lower antenna,
and strong repeater signals on the high antenna,
but it doesn't quite receive the [985 repeater](https://w3gmsrepeater.com/).
