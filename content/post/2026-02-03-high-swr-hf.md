I was seeing high SWR
and started needing the tuner
for the 80M EFHW.
I checked/reseated connections at the wire and un-un
with no change.
I started testing down the line,
and found that the outside connection
to the pass-through cable was bad:
it started pulling apart.
I replaced the window pass-through,
and now SWR is good again without the tuner.
