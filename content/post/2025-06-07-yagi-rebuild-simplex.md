### YAGI Repairs
I straightened the elements,
and replaced the driven elements
that were loose with longer elements
for sturdier mount.
I trimmed the new elements to tune,
and soldered a new hairpin match
to further reduce SWR to 1.5:1.
With this repair,
I'm tickling S9 reception, again,
listening to [W3GMS](https://w3gmsrepeater.com/)
(146.985)
pointing in the their direction.

### Simplex Net
I further tested by checking in
to the West Control
in Hellam Township
with 5W and the YAGI aimed West.
I didn't hear many other people,
and Central Control (W3NY) was booming.
