### My Weeks in Radio

* [French Creek State Park (US-1355)](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1355)
  * All FT8, 1-2W.
  * Tried PSK, but no one responded.
* 80M EFHW, 130ft
  * Built a 64:1 unun for it to help match better than the 49:1.
  * Resonant in many places, maybe need tuner in one band.
* Customizing Allstarlink node to make it easier to manage.
* New R1CBU firmware for my X6100.
* Getting tempted about the zbit or sbit,
  but the X6100 scratches that itch
  for being able to customize it.
