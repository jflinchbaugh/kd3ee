I used the fully-extended, large dipole kit
and the RTL-SDR
to successfully receive lots of 40m signals.
It may have been especially busy,
since it was Labor Day in the US and Canada.
I found FT8 (40m and elsewhere) signals
from St Lucia, Slovinia, South America, Cuba,
and a little FT4 (40m).

I also found some BPSK31, RTTY/45, and still unidentified digital signals.
