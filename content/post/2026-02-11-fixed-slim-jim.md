The Slim Jim in the tree wasn't working,
so my APRS radio had gone quiet.
I started testing
with the nanoVNA
before going out in the cold
to check the connections.
I found the lead inside was not passing any signal.
The connector at the radio was pulling off the cable,
so I could push it back together
and re-crimp it.
I got away with the easy fix.
